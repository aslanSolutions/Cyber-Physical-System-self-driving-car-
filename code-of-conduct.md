## Assignment 4

1. We plan to collaborate by task delegation. Assigning each member to each task will make sure we achieve our goals and meet our expectations. We are also planning to have daily stand up meetings. Where each member showcase what they have done and also what they will be doing. 

2. We are going to be using discord as our main communication method. As well as trello, to structure the tasks for each team member. This will allow us to monitor the progress of each team member as well as provide necessary aid. 

3. We are planning to have a short learning session each week to discuss and share what each member has learned. By doing it this way, we will ensure that the knowledge is transferred in a correct and structured manner. This will also encourage a discussion session in the team, which will lead to more ideas and insights being shared.

In addition to the weekly learning sessions, we will also implement the following knowledge sharing practices:
 
    - Knowledge Management Platform: We will establish a central knowledge management platform, such as a wiki or a shared drive, where team members can easily access and share resources, documents, and best practices. This will help create a centralized repository of knowledge that the entire team can refer to. And by adding this feature of the LLM suggestion to the structure of the learning to the team we will be able to share the new skills to the team members, even if they did not have any specific tasks.

    - Video Conferencing Tools: We will utilize video conferencing tools like Zoom and Microsoft Teams to facilitate real-time discussions, presentations, and knowledge sharing sessions. This will allow team members who are working remotely or in different locations to actively participate and engage in the knowledge transfer process. Here we add to our plan by getting the suggestion of the LLM about having an online session for the learning each week about the new skills in the team members.
 
    - Project Management Tools: We will use project management tools like Asana or Trello to track progress, share updates, and collaborate on tasks. These tools will also serve as a platform for team members to share their learnings, insights, and best practices related to the project. By having this type of tool, the team will be able to track the task and the working process for other team members and what is left and what is done in the project.

By implementing these knowledge sharing practices, we aim to create a culture of continuous learning and collaboration within the team. The weekly learning sessions will ensure regular knowledge transfer, while the knowledge management platform, video conferencing tools, and project management tools will provide the necessary infrastructure to support and facilitate this process.

4. Our usual communication plan is going to be online through discord, as well as meeting at campus once each week. Where we will be discussing issues that might have occurred during the week and try to solve them on site. 

5. As we have great experience from our previous courses. We will be applying those methods to help us solve conflicts as well as try to avoid them. One of the strategies we are planning to implement is raising the issue early. We have learnt from our experience that it's better for the team dynamic to eliminate the issue early, and to try to solve the conflict while it's at its early stage.

    We want to make a comfortable environment for everyone in the team. And by achieving a comfortable environment we believe that everyone in the team can contribute to their fullest.

6. We plan to collaborate by task delegation, assigning each member to specific tasks to achieve our goals and meet our expectations. We will have daily stand-up meetings where each member showcases their progress and plans. We will use Discord as our primary communication method and Trello to structure tasks for each team member.

To ensure transparency and traceability in using the LLM, we will establish the following guidelines:

    - Documentation: Each member must document their interactions with the LLM, including the prompt used, the LLM's response, and any modifications made to the output. This documentation should be easily accessible to all team members, for example, in a shared document or knowledge management platform.

    - Reference and citation: When incorporating LLM output into project materials, team members must clearly reference and cite the LLM as a source. This will help maintain transparency and enable other team members to review and verify the information if needed.

    - LLM usage policy: Our group will use the LLM for tasks such as idea generation, content creation, and data analysis. However, we will not rely solely on the LLM for decision-making or critical tasks without human review and validation.

    - Version control: To maintain traceability between LLM output and its use in the project, we will implement a version control system. This will allow us to track changes and identify the origin of any content or ideas generated by the LLM.

    - Regular review and validation: Team members will be responsible for reviewing and validating any LLM output before incorporating it into the project. This will help ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information.

By implementing these guidelines, we aim to create a transparent and traceable process for using the LLM in our project, reducing the risk of losing track of its contributions and facilitating discussions and resolution of any disagreements that may arise.

Additionally, we will establish a central knowledge management platform, such as a wiki or shared drive, where team members can share resources, documents, and best practices related to LLM usage. This will help ensure that knowledge is transferred correctly and consistently within the team.

Our usual communication plan will involve online communication through Discord and weekly in-person meetings on campus to discuss any issues and solve them collaboratively. By applying conflict resolution strategies from our previous courses, such as raising issues early and promoting open communication, we aim to create a comfortable and productive environment for all team members.
