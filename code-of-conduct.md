## Assignment 4

1. We plan to collaborate by task delegation. Assigning each member to each task will make sure we achieve our goals and meet our expectations. We are also planning to have daily stand up meetings. Where each member showcase what they have done and also what they will be doing. 

2. We are going to be using discord as our main communication method. As well as trello, to structure the tasks for each team member. This will allow us to monitor the progress of each team member as well as provide necessary aid. 

3. We are planning to have a short learning session each week to discuss and share what each member has learnt. By doing it this way we will ensure that the knowledge will be transferred in a correct way. This will also encourage a discussion session in the team which will lead to more ideas and insight being shared.Additionally, we got some suggestions from local LLM, it suggested: 

    - Knowledge Management Platform: Establish a central knowledge management platform where team members can share resources, documents, and best practices.Consider tools like wikis, shared drives, or dedicated knowledge base.
    - Video conferencing tools: Video conferencing tools like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Skype allow team members to connect in real-time and engage in
 discussions, presentations, and knowledge sharing.
    - Project management tools: Project management tools like Asana, Trello, and Monday.com provide a centralized platform for team members to collaborate, track progress, and share updates.

4. Our usual communication plan is going to be online through discord, as well as meeting at campus once each week. Where we will be discussing issues that might have occurred during the week and try to solve them on site. 

5. As we have great experience from our previous courses. We will be applying those methods to help us solve conflicts as well as try to avoid them. One of the strategies we are planning to implement is raising the issue early. We have learnt from our experience that it's better for the team dynamic to eliminate the issue early, and to try to solve the conflict while it's at its early stage.

    We want to make a comfortable environment for everyone in the team. And by achieving a comfortable environment we believe that everyone in the team can contribute to their fullest.

6. Each member has a responsibility to document and to reference what part of the document has been assisted with the use of LLM. It is also the responsibility of each member to double check that the information provided by the LLM is verifiable and valid.
